#' @param quiet a logical value, passed to [curl::curl_download()], which does
#' the downloading.  If this is TRUE (the default), then the work is done
#' quietly. Until version version 0.1.12, this parameter was called `silent`,
#' but it was renamed to match the corresponding argument in
#' [curl::curl_download()], which may be more familiar to users.
